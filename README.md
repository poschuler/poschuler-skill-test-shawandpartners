## Skill test Shaw and Partners

I found a "skill test" on the Internet, which I implemented using [Remix](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/guides/spa-mode) SPA mode and noje.js. The project also uses [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

You can find the challenge description in he `challenge-es.md`, wich is spanish by the way. You can find an english version of the challenge, translated using chatGPT, in the `challenge-en.md`

First run npm install in the root folder, this install the packages in boot projects, frontend & backend

```shellscript
npm install
```

Then you can run the project running the `dev` or `start` scripts or run the `tests` if you want.

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

```shellscript
npm run start
```

```shellscript
npm run test
```
