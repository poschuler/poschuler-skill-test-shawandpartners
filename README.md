## Skill test Shaw and Partners

I found a "skill test" on the Internet, which I implemented using [Remix](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/guides/spa-mode) SPA mode and noje.js. The project also uses [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

You can find the challenge description in he challenge.md, wich is spanish, by the way.

First run npm install in the root folder, this install the packages in boot projects, frontend & backend

```shellscript
npm install
```

Then you can run the project running the dev or start scripts or run the tests if you want.

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

```shellscript
npm run start
```

```shellscript
npm run tests
```
